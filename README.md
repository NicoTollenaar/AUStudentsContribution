# Questions

1. How do you use the ETH JSON RPC method eth_signTransaction? Who holds the private key in order to be able to produce the returned signed transaction object?

2. More generally, how do you send a signed transaction to the network using JSON RPC methods (eth_signTransaction, eth_sendTransaction and/or ether_sendRawTransaction)? It is not clear to me who holds and applies the private keys when using these methods.

3. How to you retrieve or see contract storage data on the blockchain that has been earmarked "private"? Is this using the getStorageAt method or is there another way? How is this done exactly?

4. Is there a way of converting bytecode visible on the blockchain into human-readable source code? (sometimes this is available on etherscan but sometimes not)

5. What does one typically call the "non-EVM" layer or system with which one interacts when sending simple eth transfers without calldata, i.e. without the intention of interacting with any contract?
